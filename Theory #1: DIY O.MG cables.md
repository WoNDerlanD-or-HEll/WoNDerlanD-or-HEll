# DIY O.MG cable

## What are O.MG cables?
O.MG cables are cables developed by Hak5 and are a seemingly ordinary USB charging and data cable with a hidden twist. They have embedded implants hidden inside that allow them to act as a malicious tool. This is where the O.MG Cable stands out. Within the cable, concealed from view, is a tiny piece of hardware that acts as a mini-computer.

## Is it really possible to create a O.MG cable?
Of course! If you've come to this page, this probably means that you've been searching the internet for a while about DIY O.MG cables without any results. If so, i wish you the best!

**Warnings:**

* Warning #1: I have not tested the O.MG cable. You are free to try it, but I am not responsible for any failures or damage that may occur (XD).
  
* Warning #2: This project is solely for educational purposes. I am also not responsible for any damage the results may inflict upon.
